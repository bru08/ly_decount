"""
Frame the task as the prediction of the lymphocytes density map

* Use Unet Segmentation paradigm
* try more sophisticated encoder structure with pretrained weights from
    https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch
* Density map based lables are built in the following way:
    * Input: point-like annotations
    * Create mask with same width and height as image
    * assign value t to pixel corresponding to point annotations
    * Convolve with gaussian kernel with dev = s

Values for t and s are hyperparamters.
